### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Mai!

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on data science projects, mainly in computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation. 
Data science and technologies are constantly evolving everyday, and I'm excited that there's always something new to learn and explore! 

ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning more of the devops tools like Ansible and Terraform, and reading up on the emerging web3.
